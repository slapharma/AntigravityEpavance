## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Quota Reset
- Quota resets in approximately 2 hours (12:03 PM)
- Can then generate remaining 18+ images in batches

### Option 2: Use Placeholder Images Temporarily
- Implement pages with placeholder boxes
- Add images as they become available
- Allows development to continue immediately

### Option 3: Manual Image Creation
- Use design tools (Canva, Figma, Photoshop)
- Create custom graphics based on prompts above
- More control over final design

### Option 4: Stock + Custom Hybrid
- Use high-quality medical stock photos for some pages
- Generate custom graphics for key brand elements
- Faster implementation, less unique

## Recommended Approach

**HYBRID STRATEGY:**
1. **Continue development NOW** with the 6 images we have
2. **Use placeholder boxes** for missing images (with proper sizing)
3. **Generate remaining images** when quota resets
4. **Replace placeholders** as images become available

This allows us to:
- ✅ Keep momentum on development
- ✅ Test layouts and functionality
- ✅ Get your feedback on structure
- ✅ Add images progressively
